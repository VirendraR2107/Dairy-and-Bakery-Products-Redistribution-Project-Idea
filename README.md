1. Problem Statement
The goal is to develop an application that helps manufacturers and merchants of bakery and dairy products manage inventory, alert them on expirations, and redistribute products to minimize waste. This will enhance operational efficiency, reduce losses, and maintain market reputation. Our country is already at a developing stage, and this is the right time to implement such initiatives. Due to stock expiration concerns, retailers currently purchase fewer items with limited variety. By implementing this system, we can build trust and assurance, driving significant enhancement to our product variety.

 2.Business Need Assessment
There is an increasing demand for efficient inventory management solutions among bakery and dairy product manufacturers and retailers. Accurate tracking and timely redistribution of near-expiry products are essential for these stakeholders to minimize waste, comply with food safety regulations, and optimize supply chain operations.

15. Conclusion
This project aims to provide an innovative solution for managing bakery and dairy product inventories using data science. By leveraging advanced predictive analytics and IoT technology, we can offer valuable insights to stakeholders, helping them make informed decisions to minimize waste and maintain product quality while building long-term partnerships based on trust.
Another idea is to create a mediator company to handle all these tasks and earn commissions on a per-task basis. This would relieve retailers and wholesalers from the additional burden, allowing them to focus on their primary work.
